        "Government Has Flagged Concerns Over The Surge of Quick Commerce Apps in India\n\nBlinkit, Zepto, Swiggy Instamart Seem To Be Impacting Small Businesses & Local Kirana\n\nConvenience and Discounts are The Biggest Reasons Why People Like Quick Commerce",
        "India's retail sector is a tale of two distinct consumer segments, each with its unique characteristics and preferences. On one side, we have the traditional value-conscious shoppers\u2014primarily low to mid-income households\u2014who rely on their local neighbourhood stores for daily essentials. On the other, there are the experience-conscious shoppers, typically from mid to affluent households, who prioritize convenience, quality, and variety. While there's some crossover between these segments, with consumers from one side occasionally shopping like the other, their core buying behaviors remain distinct.\n\nThe traditional value-conscious segment, accounting for over 80% of India's total retail sales, exhibits notable preferences. These consumers gravitate towards local kirana stores, prefer smaller pack sizes, display high price sensitivity, and often rely on informal credit systems (buy now, pay later). A recent report by the Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) revealed that a staggering 80% of India's population continues to consume unbranded goods, particularly in categories such as food grains, oil, groceries, and certain personal care items.\n\nIn contrast, the experience-conscious segment prefers organized retail and e-commerce platforms. They opt for larger packet sizes that offer better deals. They exhibit relatively lower price sensitivity and prioritize convenience and quality in their shopping experience. This segment tends to limit their choices to established brands, emphasizing product safety and reliability. They also engage more in exploratory shopping, both in physical stores and online platforms, to discover new products and brands.\n\nThe emergence of quick commerce has added a new dimension to this landscape. Approximately 30-35% of e-commerce and organized retail sales in India belong to categories (and products) conducive to quick commerce. These categories typically include fast-moving items with low shelf life that are frequently and repeatedly purchased. Groceries and over-the-counter pharmaceuticals stand out, with 80-90% of SKUs in these categories being highly suitable for quick commerce.\n\nHowever, not all categories fit neatly into the quick commerce model. Electronics and apparel, for instance, have lower quick commerce suitability, with only about 15-20% of their SKUs being appropriate for instant delivery.\n\nCategories like fashion and apparel involve a significant aspect of catalog browsing and discovery. Consumers in these segments value variety and the ability to choose from a large catalog of products, making it challenging for quick commerce players to cater to these needs. Offering a large catalog would slow down inventory turnover, increase shelf-times, and reduce profitability. Efficient dark store management is crucial for quick commerce profitability, and categories requiring extensive catalogs are inherently not conducive to this model.\n\nIt is particularly interesting to see how such categories (that require catalog browsing and discovery) migrate towards quick commerce. In this context, it's worth noting the strategies of Jio, which operates in both offline retail and e-commerce, and Delhivery, a logistics provider. These companies are building solutions for 2-4 hour delivery while supporting a wider range of products and choices. This sweet spot could be the key to unlocking the next phase of growth in India's evolving retail landscape. Companies that manage to solve this challenge of migrating discovery and browsing-oriented categories towards quick-commerce are likely to see significant business acceleration from hereon.\n\nThe future of retail in India hinges on how effectively businesses can integrate speed, variety, and convenience to meet the diverse needs of consumers.\n\n#RetailSales #QuickCommerce #OfflineRetail #Ecommerce #FMCG #KiranaStores #ConsumerBehavior #DigitalIndia #Logistics #DarkStores #Apparel #Electronics #Grocery #Pharmacy \n\n*Also see \nhttps://\nx.com/swaminathankp/\nstatus/1821857566600933487\n\u2026",
